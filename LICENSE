"Help the World Grow" (like MIT) License
This project is a gift to the world. It is free and open-source. You are permitted to use it for private and commercial purposes, 
modify it, and distribute it.

The world needs free resources to grow and evolve. Often, it's individuals like me who invest their time and passion into projects, 
making them accessible for everyone. However, free development is not always easy and requires ongoing support.

If you find this project useful and you use it for commercial purposes where you make a financial profit, 
please consider giving something back. Even a small contribution can help to finance ongoing development and enable myself and 
other developers to continue sharing our work with the world.

The generosity and support of the community allow projects like this to thrive. 
Every gift, no matter its size, is deeply appreciated and helps make the world a little bit better.

All gifts are used to support my free projects such as JADE and JADE Advisor.
